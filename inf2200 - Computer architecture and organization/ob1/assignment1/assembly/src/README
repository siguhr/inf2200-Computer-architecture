To compile the program you need these files:

asm.S - Assembly part of the mrg2 function
main.c - The full mergesort program which also supports the assembly script
asmdef.h - Define the assembly function

Optional:
the folder contains another assembly script which is a bit larger. 
To use this file just rename it as asm.S and move it to the main folder with the previous files.

Makefile - Used for compiling the code

To compile with the terminal go to the corresponding directory and type in:

make program

That compiles the program, to run it type in:

./program assembly
or
./program c

The difference is what languange should be compiled.

to clean up after compiling:

make clean

To profile last run, type in:

gprof -p -b program gmon.out > analysis.txt
