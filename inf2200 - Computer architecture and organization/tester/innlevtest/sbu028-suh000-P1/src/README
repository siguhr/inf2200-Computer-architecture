To compile the program you need these files:

asm.S - Assembly part of the mrg2 function
main.c - The full mergesort program which also supports the assembly script
asmdef.h - Define the assembly function

Makefile - Used for compiling the code

To compile with the terminal go to the corresponding directory and type in:

make program

That compiles the program, to run it type in:

./program assembly
or
./program c

The difference is what languange should be executed.

to clean up:

make clean


Extra: in main.c line 146 you can change the x integer to have the function do more or less
